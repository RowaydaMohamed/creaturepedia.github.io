            <p>Eagles inhabit a variety of ecosystems, including coastal areas, forests, mountains, grasslands, and wetlands. Coastal regions provide them with ample opportunities to hunt for fish and seabirds, while forests offer ideal nesting sites and hunting grounds for small mammals and birds. In mountainous terrain, eagles hunt for prey such as mountain goats and rodents, utilizing high cliffs and rocky outcrops for nesting. Open grasslands and savannas provide eagles with expansive hunting grounds, where they can prey on ground-dwelling animals. Wetlands, including marshes and lakeshores, attract eagles with abundant fish and waterfowl.</p>
