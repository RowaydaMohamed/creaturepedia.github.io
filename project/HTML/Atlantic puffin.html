            <td class="tdap">The Atlantic puffin is a small seabird with a distinctive appearance. During the breeding season, it sports a colorful bill with shades of orange, yellow, and blue, along with bright white cheeks and a black crown. Its body is primarily black on top and white underneath. Outside the breeding season, its plumage becomes darker, and its bill loses some of its vibrant colors.</td>

        <tr class="rodytr">
            <td class="tdap">Habitat:</td>
            <td class="tdap">Atlantic puffins are found in the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly in regions with rocky coastal cliffs and offshore islands. They nest in burrows or rocky crevices, often in large colonies.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="rodytr">
            <td class="tdap">Diet:</td>
            <td class="tdap">Puffins primarily feed on small fish such as sand eels, herring, and capelin, as well as crustaceans and marine invertebrates. They catch their prey by diving underwater, using their wings to propel themselves.</td>
        </tr>  
        <tr class="rodytr">
            <td class="tdap">Behavior:</td>
            <td class="tdap"> Puffins are highly skilled flyers and adept swimmers. They can dive to depths of up to 60 meters (200 feet) in search of food and can stay underwater for about a minute. During the breeding season, they form monogamous pairs and return to their nesting sites, often the same ones each year.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="rodytr">
            <td class="tdap">Conservation Status:</td>
            <td class="tdap">The Atlantic puffin is listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List due to threats such as habitat destruction, overfishing leading to food scarcity, pollution, and climate change affecting their prey distribution and breeding success.
                Lifespan: In the wild, Atlantic puffins typically live for 20 to 30 years, although some individuals may live longer.</td>    
        </tr>
        <tr class="rodytr">
            <td class="tdap">Unique Features:</td>
            <td class="tdap">Besides their colorful beaks during the breeding season, puffins have specialized bills that allow them to hold several fish at once, enabling them to transport food back to their chicks. They also have waterproof feathers and special glands near their eyes that help remove excess salt from their bodies after consuming seawater.</td>
