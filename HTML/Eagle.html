            <p>Eagles inhabit a variety of ecosystems, including coastal areas, forests, mountains, grasslands, and wetlands. Coastal regions provide them with ample opportunities to hunt for fish and seabirds, while forests offer ideal nesting sites and hunting grounds for small mammals and birds. In mountainous terrain, eagles hunt for prey such as mountain goats and rodents, utilizing high cliffs and rocky outcrops for nesting. Open grasslands and savannas provide eagles with expansive hunting grounds, where they can prey on ground-dwelling animals. Wetlands, including marshes and lakeshores, attract eagles with abundant fish and waterfowl.</p>

            <p>Eagles are distributed across the globe, with different species found on every continent except Antarctica. They are particularly common in North America, where the iconic bald eagle reigns supreme, and in Europe, where the majestic white-tailed eagle soars along coastal regions and wetlands. In Africa, the African fish eagle is a common sight around freshwater lakes and rivers, while Asia is home to diverse eagle species such as the golden eagle and steppe eagle. Even Australia boasts its own formidable predator, the wedge-tailed eagle, which dominates the skies over vast inland regions and coastal areas.</p>
