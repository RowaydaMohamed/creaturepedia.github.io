        <tr>
            <td>Physical Characteristics:</td>
            <td>Appearance: Great whites are known for their distinctive torpedo-shaped bodies, grayish-blue dorsal surface, and white underbellies, which provide effective camouflage when viewed from above or below.<br>
                Size: They are among the largest predatory fish, with adult females typically measuring between 15 to 21 feet (4.6 to 6.4 meters) in length, although specimens over 20 feet are rare. Males are usually smaller, ranging from 11 to 13 feet (3.4 to 4 meters).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Habitat:</td>
            <td>Range: Great white sharks are found in coastal and offshore waters of major oceans, primarily in cool and temperate regions.<br>
                Migration: They are known for their extensive migrations, often traveling thousands of miles in search of food and suitable breeding grounds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Diet:</td>
            <td>Predators: Great whites are apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the marine food chain and have few natural predators themselves.<br>
                Diet: Their diet consists mainly of marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and occasionally smaller cetaceans, as well as fish and seabirds.<br>
                Hunting Strategy: Great whites are opportunistic hunters, using ambush tactics and bursts of speed to surprise their prey. They are also known for breaching the water's surface when attacking prey from below.</td>
        </tr>  
        <tr>
            <td>Behavior:</td>
            <td> Social Structure: Great whites are generally solitary animals, although they may congregate in areas with abundant food sources, such as seal colonies.<br>
                Thermoregulation: They are capable of regulating their body temperature and can tolerate a wide range of water temperatures.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Conservation Status:</td>
            <td>Threats: Great white sharks face several threats, including overfishing, habitat degradation, accidental capture in fishing gear (bycatch), and persecution by humans.<br>
                Conservation Efforts: Due to their role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, great whites are protected by various international agreements and conservation initiatives. However, they are still considered vulnerable due to their slow reproductive rates and low population densities.</td>
